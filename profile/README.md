# Snow River Advisory

**Snow River Advisory** is a fractional CFO + Controller firm serving small and mid-sized **nonprofit organizations in Alaska**.

We are currently building the firm’s foundational systems ahead of a planned public launch in **early 2027**. Our work is grounded in three principles:

- **Clarity** — Transforming complexity into financial understanding.  
- **Insight** — Turning data into strategic guidance for confident decision-making.  
- **Stewardship** — Honoring mission-driven work through disciplined and transparent financial practices.

This GitHub organization hosts the **public-facing resources** Snow River Advisory chooses to share with the nonprofit community. These materials reflect our approach to financial management and may include:

- Example financial models and forecasting templates  
- Reporting layouts and dashboards  
- Checklists, tools, and selected reference materials  

Public resources are curated and published here.  
Internal infrastructure and operational systems are maintained separately within **Snow River HQ**.
