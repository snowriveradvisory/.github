# Snow River Advisory

Snow River Advisory is a long-term project currently in a research, exploration, and foundation-building phase. Our work is guided by three principles:

- **Clarity** — Bringing structure and simplicity to complex systems.
- **Insight** — Developing thoughtful approaches grounded in careful observation and analysis.
- **Stewardship** — Building with intention, discipline, and long-term sustainability in mind.

This GitHub organization hosts the **public-facing resources** that Snow River Advisory chooses to share as part of its ongoing exploration. These materials may include:

- Conceptual frameworks and reference guides  
- Example layouts, templates, or prototypes  
- Selected tools developed through internal research  

These resources reflect ideas and practices we are shaping behind the scenes.

### Internal Work  
Snow River Advisory also maintains **Snow River HQ**, a separate internal organization used for exploratory systems, infrastructure, and other behind-the-scenes development work.  
All public materials are curated and published exclusively within this organization.
